<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project aims to analyze consumer preferences for specialty coffee and identify the key factors that influence coffee quality. Using datasets that capture taster preferences, coffee characteristics, and expert evaluations, the goal is to develop personalized recommendation models and address the following research questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What sensory attributes, determined through the cupping process, have the most significant impact on overall coffee quality?</li>
    <li>Can the taster preference be predicted based on the amount of money spent on coffee and coffee equipment?</li>
    <li>How do preferences for specialty coffee differ between age groups in terms of consumption frequency, taste, roasting preferences, average monthly spending, and other coffee-related habits?</li>
</ol>
