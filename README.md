<h1>The Great American Coffee Taste Test ☕️</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project aims to analyze consumer preferences for specialty coffee and identify the key factors that influence coffee quality. Using datasets that capture taster preferences, coffee characteristics, and expert evaluations, the goal is to develop personalized recommendation models and address the following research questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What sensory attributes, determined through the cupping process, have the most significant impact on overall coffee quality?</li>
    <li>Can the taster preference be predicted based on the amount of money spent on coffee and coffee equipment?</li>
    <li>How do preferences for specialty coffee differ between age groups in terms of consumption frequency, taste, roasting preferences, average monthly spending, and other coffee-related habits?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Languages, Software and Models Used</h2>

- <b>R</b> 
- <b>Tableau</b>
- <b>Multiple Linear Regression and Stepwise, Lasso and Ridge Regression for feature selection </b>
- <b>Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning</b>

<h2>About the Data </h2>

<p>In October 2023, expert and world-champion barista James Hoffmann collaborated with Cometeer, an American coffee technology and manufacturing company, to organize a unique event called The Great American Taste Test. Five thousand coffee kits containing four pre-extracted and frozen coffee varieties were distributed during this event across America. After a blind tasting and data collection through a specialized scorecard, valuable coffee attributes were revealed. This dataset provides detailed information about coffee enthusiasts, including their declared taste preferences, coffee experience level, daily consumption habits, and other relevant demographic data.</p>

</p>

<p>Adding more rigorous data sets to supplement the convenience sample data from Hoffmann and Cometeer was necessary to address potential biases. Therefore, we combined this data with one where the quality of different varieties of coffee is evaluated by highly trained individuals of the Coffee Quality Institute. This action allowed us to compare the perception of quality between experts and consumers of specialty coffee, offering a more complete and objective view of the coffee landscape. Both datasets are available for analysis on Kaggle.</p>
